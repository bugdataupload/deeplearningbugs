# What are the Impacts of Bugs in Deep Learning Software
In this paper, we we constructed 1,820 bugs of 3 implementations of a deep learning application. 

We provide logs and the summary of a buggy version and its mutation operator, mutated file and modified line number.

The entries of Excel file are mutation node type, accuarcy, training time mutation line number and related code.
